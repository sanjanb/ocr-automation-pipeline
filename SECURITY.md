| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Where to Report
**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them responsibly through one of the following channels:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@yourdomain.com` (if applicable)
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use [GitHub's security advisory feature](https://github.com/sanjanb/ocr-automation-pipeline/security/advisories/new)
3. **Private Issue**: Create a private security issue (if your repository supports it)

### What to Include
When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source files related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We'll provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Regular Updates**: We'll send updates every 5 business days until resolved
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

## Security Measures

### Current Security Features

#### API Security
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DoS attacks
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted cross-origin requests
- **File Upload Limits**: Maximum file size restrictions
- **Content Type Validation**: Only allowed file types accepted

#### Data Security
- **No Data Persistence**: Documents are not stored after processing
- **Memory Cleanup**: Processed images cleared from memory
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **API Key Protection**: Gemini API keys secured via environment configuration

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Docker Security**: Non-root user in containers
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning with safety
- **CI/CD Security**: Secure secrets management in GitHub Actions
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Production deployments should use HTTPS

### Recommended Security Practices

#### For Deployment
1. **Use HTTPS**: Always deploy behind HTTPS in production
2. **Environment Variables**: Never commit API keys to version control
3. **Network Security**: Use firewalls and network restrictions
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
5. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring
6. **Access Control**: Restrict API access as needed

#### For Development
1. **Secure Development**: Follow OWASP guidelines
2. **Code Review**: All changes should be reviewed
3. **Dependency Management**: Regularly audit dependencies
4. **Secret Scanning**: Use tools to prevent secret commits
5. **Static Analysis**: Run security linters (bandit)

## Known Security Considerations

### File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: Only specific image formats allowed
- **File Size Limits**: 10MB maximum to prevent DoS
- **Content Scanning**: Files are validated before processing
- **Memory Management**: Files processed in memory, not saved

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- **Input Sanitization**: All inputs validated before processing
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages (no sensitive data exposure)
- **CORS Policy**: Configurable origin restrictions

### Third-Party Dependencies
- **Gemini API**: Uses official Google AI SDK
- **Dependency Monitoring**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies updated regularly
- **License Compliance**: All dependencies vetted for licensing

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Our Commitment
- We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure
- We'll work with you to understand and resolve issues quickly
- We'll credit researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly
- We'll provide updates on our progress toward resolution

### Safe Harbor
We support safe harbor for security researchers who:
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction
- Report vulnerabilities promptly and allow reasonable time for fixes
- Avoid social engineering, DoS, or physical attacks
- Don't access or modify data beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability

## Security Updates

### Update Process
1. **Critical Vulnerabilities**: Immediate patch release
2. **High Severity**: Patch within 1 week
3. **Medium/Low Severity**: Next scheduled release
4. **Security Advisories**: Published for all security fixes

### Notification Channels
- **GitHub Releases**: Security fixes noted in release notes
- **Security Advisories**: GitHub security advisory system
- **Changelog**: All security fixes documented
- **README**: Major security updates mentioned
